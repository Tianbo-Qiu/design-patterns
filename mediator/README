===========================================
              Mediator pattern
===========================================
Use a mediator for communication between
classes. For example, the ListBox needs to
talk to a Button and a TextBox when its
state changes. And a Button needs to talk
to ListBox and TextBox when its state
changes.

We have a bunch of objects that need to talk
to each other.

============================================
       Inheritance without a mediator
============================================
ArticlesListBox --------> TitleTextBox
---------------           ------------------
changed() {               changed() {
 textBox.setContent()     button.disable();
 button.enable();         }
}
===============           ==================
          |                |   ^
          v                v   |
          =======================
          SaveButton
          -----------------------
          clicked() {
            textBox.getContent();
            // update db
          }
          =======================
--------------------------------------------
fig 1-1
--------------------------------------------
We will have a lot of connections or
dependencies between classes and the logic
behind the communication is spread all over
the place.

============================================
       Inheritance with a mediator
============================================
We use another class DialogBox as the
mediator.

--------------------------------------------
ListBox:UIControl          TextBox:UIControl
=================          =================
              |             |
              v             v
              ==========================
              DialogBox
              --------------------------
              changed(UIControl control)
              ==========================
                    ^
                    |
              ================
              Button:UIControl
              ================
-------------------------------------------
fig 2-1
-------------------------------------------
We have a single place for the interaction
logic so it's not spread all over the place.

The DialogBox is mediating the interaction
of these objects, so they don't know about
each other and they only know their
mediator. Everytime there is a change in the
UControl class, it notifies the DialogBox
and the DialogBox will figure out what to do
next.

-------------------------------------------
(Abstract class)          (Interface)
================          =================
Mediator         <------- Colleague
================          =================
      ^                          ^
      |                          |
================          =================
ConcreteMediator -------> ConcreteColleague
================          =================
-------------------------------------------
fig 2-2
-------------------------------------------

============================================
       Refactor with Observer pattern
============================================
We can refactor the UIControl to make it talk to
DialogBox inindrectly with the
observer pattern.

Each concrete class of UIControl works as
Observable and we won't have the long if
else block. The package mediator.observer
and mediator.events are implemented with
this pattern and the mediator.events is
almost the same as mediator.observer with
refactoring regarding naming and functional
interface.
